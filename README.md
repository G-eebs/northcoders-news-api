# Northcoders News API

There are two databases in this project, one with dev data and one with test data. In order to connect to these databases locally you will need to create two .env files:

- **.env.test** containing: `PGDATABASE=nc_news_test`

- **.env.development** containing: `PGDATABASE=nc_news`
